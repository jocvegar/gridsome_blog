  <p>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I'm surprised you had the courage to
  take the responsibility yourself. 


  <strong> What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it?</strong>


  <em> Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage.</em>
  It's more like…suicide.</p>


  <p>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking
  that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. Your
