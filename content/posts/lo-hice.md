  <p>I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire,
  I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long
  way from here. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her
  away!</p>

  <p>Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. <strong> It's
  late, I'm in for it as it is.</strong> <em> Look, I can take you as far as
  Anchorhead.</em> You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever
  you're going.</p>

  <h2>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're
  best at, ain't it?</h2>

  <p>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding
  their secret base. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in
  it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.</p>
