  <h1>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self
  and act on instinct.</h1>

  <p>Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission
  this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I
  want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Ye-ha!</p>

  <p>What!? Ye-ha! What!? Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. <strong> You
  weren't on any mercy mission this time.</strong> <em> Several transmissions
  were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.</em> I want to know what happened to
  the plans they sent you.</p>

  <h2>Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.</h2>

  <p>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're
  best at, ain't it? As you wish. What!? Kid, I've flown from one side of this
  galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen
  anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling
  everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's
  all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>

  <li>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</li><li>Alderaan? I'm not going to
  Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.</li><li>The

  <h3>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</h3>

  <p>Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission
  this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I
  want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Remember, a Jedi can
  feel the Force flowing through him.</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?</li><li>You're all
  clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!</li><li>A tremor in the Force.
  The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</li>

  </ul>


  <p>I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? What!? Escape is not his plan. I
  must face him, alone. I'm trying not to, kid. Escape is not his plan. I must
  face him, alone.</p>

  <p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this
  sort of thing. As you wish. You mean it controls your actions? Escape is not
  his plan. I must face him, alone. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now
  she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>

  <p>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Don't act
  so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time.
  Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know
  what happened to the plans they sent you.</p>

  <p>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're
  best at, ain't it? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the
  presence of my old master. In my experience, there is no such thing as
  luck.</p>

  <p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this
  sort of thing. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good
  blaster at your side, kid. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the
  responsibility yourself.</p>

  <p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on
  board were killed. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a
  detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander.
  There'll be no one to stop us this time!</p>

  <p>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip
  through your fingers. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. As
  you wish. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? I have traced the Rebel
  spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>

  <p>Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot
  of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one
  all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field
  that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I
  care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</p>

  <p>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Obi-Wan
  is here. The Force is with him. Don't underestimate the Force. What good is a
  reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station
  ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.</p>

  <p>I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? You're all clear, kid. Let's
  blow this thing and go home! Red Five standing by. Kid, I've flown from one
  side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've
  never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force
  controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my
  destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>

  <p>Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. As you wish. As you wish.
  Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Hokey religions and
  ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
